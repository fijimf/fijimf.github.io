# Starting Development for the 2019 Season

### 95 days until the first tip-off of the 2019 season
Well the site is undergoing for its usual annual update.  With 95 days until the first tip, one would hope I can beat it into shape for the start of the season.

I've decided to learn React.js as a front-end technology, while sticking with the Play! framework for the back end.  So 95 days might not be eenough to redo the the entire site...

On the postive side, my Play! version is up to date, and Play! continues to delight.  Thanks to the free book from underscore.io, Slick has also bent to my will quite dutifully.

I'm not sure if I will use AWS EMR with Spark for geneartion of statistics which I experimented with earlier this year

So I'm kind of in layout hell.  Bootstrap 4 has fully embraced flexbox, which is...different than the old 12 column layout.  I don't even care that much about responsive layout, I'd just like it to look good on screen.

I made good progress on pushing JSON data into my React componenets from Play!, but I'm still very far from fluent with React.

Also I need to figure out how to compile, package and deploy this stuff.

Two and a half hours to get my Bootstrap 4 navbar to look the way I want it to.  And is barely responsive.  UI is hard.

Ok, more React stuff -- porting over the Sign In/Sign Out/Sign Up/Forgot Password pages to my half-assed React implementation.  I use Silhouette for auth stuff on the Play! side, and I can't help but think I'm introducing some security hole.  Of course secirty omn the site is either very weak or vey strong. (Just check the code to identify admin users.)

Regardless, progress is being made.

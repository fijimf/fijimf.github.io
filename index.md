# Starting Development for the 2020 Season

## July 30, 2019 
### 99 days until the first tip-off of the 2020 season
Yikes.  As per usual I'm completely unready for the upcoming season.  While last season I decided to fruitlessly screw around with Javascript libraries I knew nothing about, this year I've decided to mess with final tagless and cats effect, and rewrite huge swaths of the back end, and switch to doobie over slick for JDBC, and swap out MySQL for Postgres.  Oh yeah, and dockerize it too.

99 days.

### Starting Development for the 2019 Season

## August 6, 2018 -- 95 days until the first tip odf the 2019 season
Well the site is undergoing for its usual annual update.  With 95 dfays until the first tip, one would hope I can beat in into shape for the start of the season.

I've decided to lear React.js as a front-end technology, while sticking with the Play! framework for the back end.  So 95 days might not be eenough to redo the the site...

On the postive side, ny Play! version is up to date, and Play! continues to delight.  Thanks to the free book from underscore.io, Slick has also bent to my will quite dutifully.

I'm not sure if I will use AWS EMR with Spark for geneartion of statistics which I experimented with earlier this year
